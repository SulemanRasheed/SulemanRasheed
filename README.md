## üß† Portfolio Projects

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Monash Health Surgery Wait Times Dashboard  

This **Power BI** dashboard presents a side-by-side comparison of elective surgery wait times across urgent, semi-urgent, and non-urgent categories at Monash Health (2018‚Äì2023).  
It enables rapid comparison of volumes, wait times, and compliance rates ‚Äî providing stakeholders with actionable insights for operational and clinical decision-making.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Predicting Hand Movements of Stroke Patients from Brain Signals  

This study benchmarked multiple EEG-based brain‚Äìcomputer interface (BCI) pipelines for classifying hand-grasp intentions in stroke patients.  
Using **Python** (NumPy, SciPy, MNE, scikit-learn), I implemented five algorithms ‚Äî from classical signal processing (Wavelet Transform, PSD) to **motor imagery methods (CSP, FBCSP)** and the deep-learning-based **EEGNet**.

Results showed **FBCSP** best for within-subject decoding (~84.8% accuracy), while **EEGNet** achieved superior cross-subject generalisation (~77.0% accuracy).  
This benchmark supports the design of **assistive robotic and rehabilitation BCIs**.
