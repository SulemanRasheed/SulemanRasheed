Benchmarked EEG-based Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) pipelines for decoding motor imagery in stroke patients.  
Implemented five algorithms in Python — from CSP / FBCSP and PSD / Wavelets to EEGNet (deep learning).

**Findings:**  
- FBCSP achieved the highest within-subject accuracy (~84.8%)  
- EEGNet provided the strongest cross-subject generalisation (~77.0%)  
This benchmark supports the development of assistive robotic and rehabilitation BCIs.

**Tools:** Python, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, MNE-Python, Matplotlib
