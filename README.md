## üß† Research & Data Science Portfolio

### 1. Healthcare Financial Dashboard  
This interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes healthcare billing data across Australian cities, procedures, departments, and demographics. It provides insights into treatment costs, insurance coverage, and patient out-of-pocket expenses, with dynamic filtering by year and ethnicity.

Designed for hospital administrators, policy analysts, and health service researchers to benchmark costs by procedure and department, understand disparities in care costs across demographic groups, and explore regional variation in healthcare spending.

### 2. Monash Health Surgery Wait Times Dashboard  

This Power BI dashboard presents a side-by-side comparison of elective surgery wait times across urgent, semi-urgent, and non-urgent categories at Monash Health, a major Local Hospital Network in Australia, from 2018 to 2023.

It enables rapid comparison of volumes, wait times, and compliance rates, providing stakeholders with actionable insights for operational and clinical decision-making.

### 3. Victoria EPA Air Quality Dashboard  
This interactive R Shiny application visualises EPA Victoria‚Äôs 2024 air quality data. It allows users to select a **suburb** and **pollutant** to explore daily pollutant levels throughout the year, presented in an intuitive calendar-style heatmap. 

EPA Victoria (Environment Protection Authority Victoria) is the environmental regulator for the state of Victoria, Australia. It monitors and reports on air, water, and land quality to protect public health and the environment. The air quality data used in this dashboard is sourced from EPA Victoria‚Äôs publicly available monitoring stations.

### 4. Predicting Hand-Movements of Stroke Patients from Brain Signals

This project benchmarked multiple EEG-based brain‚Äìcomputer interface (BCI) pipelines for classifying hand-grasp intentions in stroke patients. Using Python (NumPy, SciPy, MNE, and scikit-learn), I implemented and compared five popular algorithms ‚Äî including classical signal-processing methods (Wavelet Transform, PSD), motor imagery-specific techniques (CSP, FBCSP), and the EEGNet deep neural network.

The study revealed that FBCSP remains the most effective for within-subject decoding (‚âà 84.8% accuracy), while EEGNet excels in cross-subject generalisation (‚âà 77.0% accuracy). These findings provide an open benchmark for selecting suitable EEG pipelines in assistive robotics and rehabilitation BCIs.

Tools: Python, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, MNE-Python, Matplotlib
