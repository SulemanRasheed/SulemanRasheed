### Predicting Hand Movements of Stroke Patients from Brain Signals  
Benchmarked EEG-based **Brain–Computer Interface (BCI)** pipelines for decoding motor imagery in stroke patients.  
Implemented five algorithms in **Python** — from **CSP / FBCSP** and **PSD / Wavelets** to **EEGNet (deep learning)**.

**Findings:**  
- **FBCSP:** Highest within-subject accuracy (~84.8%)  
- **EEGNet:** Strongest cross-subject generalisation (~77.0%)  
→ Provides an open benchmark for assistive robotic and rehabilitation BCIs.
